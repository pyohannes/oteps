        note: |        
              A string identifying the messaging broker or intermediary, e. g. `kafka`,
              `rabbitmq`, `rocketmq`, `AzureEventHubs`, or `AmazonSQS`.

              If the messaging broker or intermediary are not known, this should be set to a
              value that best identifies the usage scenario. This could be the messaging
              library used (e. g. `jms`), or the protocol used (e. g. `amqp`).

              A list of recommended values will be provided independently of the messaging
              semantic conventions document.

        brief: 'The kind of message destination'
        note: | 
          Different brokers have different concepts of message destinations, the most
          popular being queues and topics. One of the most important differences in
          destination kinds is how messages are settled: messages are settled
          individually in queues, whereas messages are settled based on checkpoints in
          topics. Individual brokers might specify additional destination kinds.

        brief: 'Low cardinality field representing messaging destination'
        examples: ['/customers/{customerId}']
        note: | 
          In some instances, message destination names are constructed from templates. An
          example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id.
          Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality, the
          underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively used for
          grouping and searching spans.

          This attribute is optional, but recommended if the destination name is created
          based on such a template.
      - id: destination.temporary
        type: boolean
        requirement_level:
          recommended: when supported by messaging system and only if the destination is temporary. If missing, assumed to be false.

        type: boolean
        requirement_level:
          recommended: when supported by messaging system and only if the destination is anonymous. If missing, assumed to be false.
        brief: 'denotes that the destination is an anonymous destination (could be unnamed or have auto-generated name)'
        note: |
          If set to `true`, this flag denotes that the destination is a temporary
          destination and might not exist anymore after messages are processed.

          The source name defines the name of the source of a message, as
          specified by the consumer. There are different kinds of sources, varying
          between message brokers, e. g. queues in RabbitMQ or topics in
          Kafka.

          This attributes is required for consumer spans modelling `deliver`, `receive`,
          or `settle` operations. The name of the source a message is received from can
          be different from the name of the destination a message was sent to.
